# Annihilation - A Literary Analysis via Twitter Feed

This is an English class final project which interprets the book *Annihilation* by Jeff VanderMeer, and retells it in a new way by pretending the main character, named "biologist" had a Twitter account and tweeted her thoughts, experience, and actions.

For those who've read the book, it's a little ironic because the area she's exploring (Area X) has no technology permitted by the government for one, and secondly she's more of an introverted, nature-loving person, so she doesn't fit the profile of someone who would use Twitter.

This app is written is written React.js, and hosted online with Express.js. This is literally my first React app, so excuse the garbage. Cheers.
